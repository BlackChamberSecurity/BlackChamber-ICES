# Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Black Chamber ("We" or "Us"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") creates a clear record of the intellectual property rights in your contributions. It ensures that We have the necessary legal rights to maintain and distribute the project while you retain ownership of your contributions.

## 1. Definitions

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Us. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered a single Contributor.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Us (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Foundation or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Us for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

## 4. You Represent That:

1.  You are legally entitled to grant the above license.
2.  If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to Us, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Us.
3.  Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).
4.  Your Contribution includes complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contribution.

## 5. Support

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 6. Commitment to Open Source

Use of the Contributions in a Commercial Product does not diminish our commitment to Open Source. We agree to make the source code for the Work available under the terms of the Business Source License 1.1 (or a successor version) and eventually the Apache License 2.0 (or a successor version), as specified in the LICENSE file distributed with the Work.

## 7. Trademarks

This Agreement does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work.
